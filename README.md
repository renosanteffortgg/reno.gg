my self reno
i like to code and be online on discord for like 10-12 hrs
so, we were about to study a'bout some basics of discord in my own sentence
1.WHAT IS A SERVER?
Discord gives you permissions to make a group of friends and create a server with roles,for safety it adds you some moderation etc etc - add bots etc talk with your friends if they're online - make sure to add bots - if moderation bots ask perms for administrating server - its ok u can give them as they r everified now
but make sure to not give your integration bot  - administrating roles bcos if hacked - it can spam and delete channels etc etc
